# Java plus Selenium project with Spring Boot

Automation tests for the OrangeHRM application.  
The project checks login, landing page, and full end-to-end workflows.  
Reports are generated after each test run and can be sent automatically by email.

## ⚙️ Project Setup

⚙️ Option 1: Run project locally

1. Open the project folder in your IDE.  
   IntelliJ is preferred, but Eclipse or any Java IDE will work.

2. Check that a file named `.env.example` exists in the project root.

3. Create a `.env` file using `.env.example` as a guide, and fill in your details as shown on the file.

4. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the project folder and run:
   mvn install
   ```

⚙️ Option 2: Run with GitHub Action

You can also run the project directly from GitHub using Actions:
- Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
- Click on the Actions tab at the top of the repository.
- Select the workflow named build.
- On the right-hand side, click the Run workflow button.
- Choose the branch main and press Run workflow again.
- GitHub will now build and test the project automatically.
- You can monitor progress and view logs in the Actions tab under the selected workflow run

   This command will download all required dependencies and build the project.

## 📧 Sending Test Reports

* Test results are stored in the `Results` folder after execution.  
* The framework automatically zips the results folder and email a zip copy to the specified email.  
* Ensure your `.env` file contains valid email details before running tests.

## 📝 Notes

* Use `.env.example` as a safe template when setting up your own configuration.  
* For any build issues, try cleaning your Maven cache or re-running `mvn install`.
